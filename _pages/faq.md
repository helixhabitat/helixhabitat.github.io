<a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">What is a zome?</a>
<div class="uk-accordion-content">
<p>A zome is a 3D architectural structure based on geometric shapes found in nature, typically made from a series of diamond or rhombus-shaped panels arranged in spiraling symmetry. Their flowing geometry creates a strong, stable shell and a naturally beautiful interior.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">How are zomes different from domes?</a>
<div class="uk-accordion-content">
<p>Zomes use trapezoids instead of triangles, giving them smoother geometry and more natural flow. They shed water and snow efficiently, offer better interior layout options, and have a signature flower-like apex. Many people find them more visually harmonious and easier to insulate.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">What sizes can a zome be built in?</a>
<div class="uk-accordion-content">
<p>Zomes can range from small 10–12 ft personal spaces to large 40+ ft structures suitable for living, wellness, or retreats. We can design custom diameters, heights, and segment counts to match your project needs.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">What materials are used to build zomes?</a>
<div class="uk-accordion-content">
<p>Zomes can be built from wood, steel, engineered timber, or hybrid systems. Our CNC-cut wooden components provide precision and fast assembly. Exterior options include cedar, metal, composites, or weather-resistant membranes.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">How long does it take to build a zome?</a>
<div class="uk-accordion-content">
<p>Design times vary, but once materials are delivered, building is fast. Small zomes may be assembled in a few days, while larger ones may take several weeks including interior finishing and utilities.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">Are zomes energy efficient?</a>
<div class="uk-accordion-content">
<p>Yes. Their geometry reduces heat loss, supports excellent airflow, and minimizes thermal bridging. With proper insulation, zomes are highly energy efficient and comfortable year-round.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">Can I live in a zome full-time?</a>
<div class="uk-accordion-content">
<p>Yes. Zomes can be engineered to meet residential building standards and include insulation, plumbing, electrical, and ventilation. Many people use them as full-time homes.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">Are zomes permitted by local building codes?</a>
<div class="uk-accordion-content">
<p>In many areas, yes. We provide architectural drawings and engineering documentation to meet building department requirements. We work with you to ensure compliance with regional codes and zoning laws.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">Are zomes good for wellness or retreat spaces?</a>
<div class="uk-accordion-content">
<p>Absolutely. Their symmetry, acoustics, and natural ambiance make them ideal for meditation rooms, yoga studios, saunas, sound healing, and retreat cabins.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">How do zomes perform in harsh weather?</a>
<div class="uk-accordion-content">
<p>Zomes are structurally robust and distribute wind loads evenly. Their sloped faces shed rain and snow efficiently. With proper material choices, they perform very well in wind, rain, snow, and seismic zones.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">Can zomes be customized?</a>
<div class="uk-accordion-content">
<p>Yes. We can customize size, height, number of bands, windows, skylights, doors, interior layouts, finishes, and more. We also provide custom CNC-cut kits for DIY builders.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">Do you offer DIY kits?</a>
<div class="uk-accordion-content">
<p>Yes. Our kits include CNC-cut labeled parts and instructions. Builders with basic carpentry skills can assemble a zome frame quickly and easily.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">Do you handle installation?</a>
<div class="uk-accordion-content">
<p>We offer complete installation services, hybrid builds, or remote guidance. For large projects, we coordinate with local contractors and engineers.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">What does a zome typically cost?</a>
<div class="uk-accordion-content">
<p>Costs vary depending on size, materials, foundation, and interior finishes. Smaller kits are priced similarly to backyard studios, while residential zomes align with custom home pricing. Estimates are provided after a consultation.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">Can zomes be connected or expanded?</a>
<div class="uk-accordion-content">
<p>Yes. Zomes can be linked through walkways, transition rooms, or direct connectors. Many clients create multi-zome compounds for retreats or community spaces.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">What foundations are used for zomes?</a>
<div class="uk-accordion-content">
<p>Common foundations include piers, slabs, helical piers, and engineered deck systems. The choice depends on soil, terrain, and utility requirements.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">How do interior walls work in a zome?</a>
<div class="uk-accordion-content">
<p>Interiors can be open or divided with radial walls, lofts, partitions, or multi-level solutions. The geometry allows creative and practical layouts.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">Do you provide 3D designs or renderings?</a>
<div class="uk-accordion-content">
<p>Yes. We create detailed 3D models, renderings, and floorplans so you can visualize your zome before construction. Interior walkthroughs are available.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">Are zomes environmentally friendly?</a>
<div class="uk-accordion-content">
<p>Zomes use less material for the enclosed volume compared to conventional buildings. We can use sustainable wood, recycled metal, and eco-friendly insulation. Their efficiency and small footprint make them ideal for green building projects.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">How do I get started?</a>
<div class="uk-accordion-content">
<p>Contact us for a consultation. Share your goals, preferred size, and intended use, and we will create a custom design, quote, and project timeline.</p>
